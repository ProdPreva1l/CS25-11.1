# The Parade
This is a silly little game made for my comp sci course.

I would have liked to add a proper story line but decided to design the project to be extensible
for the sake of showing an example of my knowledge of OOP and design patterns.

You can easily add new levels (and stages), creatures and items to the game!
While the character system isn't designed to add more, you could if you wanted to.

# How to Play
1. `pip install`
2. `py main.py`

## 2. Product Problem Statement
**Challenges Addressed**:
- **Hardware Requirements**: Many games have heavy hardware requirements, which many people cannot meet.
- **Competitive Market**: The game industry is very competitive with most games needing backing of multi-million (if not -billion) dollar companies to gain traction.
- **Skill Gap & Ceiling**: Games need to have a good balance between easy and challenging, and they need room for the player to practice and get better.
